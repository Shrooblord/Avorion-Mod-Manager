# Avorion Mod Manager
A small program that streamlines and automatically takes care of the modding process for the game Avorion by Boxelware.

This program will take you through the process of installing and tracking mods you have installed, keep their version numbers and descriptions logged and notify you of new versions as they appear on the Mod Portal. The last known compatible version of Avorion is logged, too, for your convenience.

The purview of the **Avorion Mod Manager** is to make the process of installing mods for Avorion as easy as a couple of clicks with the button, as opposed to the tedious process of manually editing the game's script files and checking diffs across different updates of the game. When a new update rolls over, the modding process should be as easy as "click and go", so you can get right back into the game. The **Avorion Mod Manager** aims to facilitate this.
